Signup at https://ipinfo.io/developers to get your API token.
Then set the token as an environment variable:

```bash
export IPINFO_TOKEN="token"
```

Next clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DesktopDefender/DesktopDefender.git
```

Open the root folder and install node modules:
```bash
cd DesktopDefender
npm install
```

Then you have two options, either run or build the project to run it as an application on your device:

## Run
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run tauri build
```





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
